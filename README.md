# Notes on Commodore C64 Assembly

Welcome dear fellows of mighty 64. Here I'm sharing my work notes on assembly. Please keep in mind that, even though I'm trying to keep things simple and easy to understand for beginners, as I am also a beginner the notes can be incomplete or bear some errors.

If you need further technical details I suggest codebase64.org
